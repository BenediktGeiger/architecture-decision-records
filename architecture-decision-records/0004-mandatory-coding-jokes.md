# 3. Mandatory Coding Jokes in Function Comments

Date: 2024-03-20

## Status

Accepted (with groans)

## Labels
general,main

## Context

Our codebase has become too serious and developers are experiencing:
- Increased stress during code reviews
- Monotonous documentation reading
- Excessive caffeine consumption to stay awake while reading logs
- Declining developer happiness metrics
- Stack Overflow answers without any personality

## Decision

We will implement mandatory coding jokes in all function comments across projects:

Format: `// [JOKE] <programming-related-pun> | <actual-function-description>`

Joke Categories Allowed:
- Programming language puns
- Database jokes (they should be relatable)
- Binary jokes (there are 10 types of people...)
- HTTP status code humor
- Bug-related comedy
- Recursive jokes that never reach a base case

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved developer mental health
- More engaging code reviews
- Easier to stay awake during documentation reading
- Creates natural ice-breakers for new team members
- Makes debugging sessions less painful

### Negative
- Increased time spent thinking of jokes
- Risk of repeated jokes (especially the binary ones)
- Some jokes might only work in specific programming languages
- Senior developers insisting their dad jokes are funny
- Pull request comments becoming comedy roasts

### Mitigation
- Create a shared joke database
- Implement a joke uniqueness checker
- Monthly awards for best programming jokes
- Establish a "joke review" committee
- Ban all "null" jokes - they're pointless

Note: Any developer caught using "Hello World" jokes will be required to fix printer issues for a week.
