# 1. Standardize Error Handling

Date: 2024-03-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Different teams and services across our organization handle errors inconsistently, leading to:
- Difficulty in debugging cross-service issues
- Inconsistent error messages for end users
- Challenges in error aggregation and monitoring
- Varying levels of error detail in logs

## Decision

We will implement a standardized error handling approach across all services:

1. All errors will follow a consistent structure:
   ```json
   {
     "code": "ERROR_TYPE_CODE",
     "message": "Human readable message",
     "correlationId": "unique-request-id",
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601 format",
     "details": { /* Additional context */ }
   }
   ```

2. Error codes will be categorized by domain (e.g., AUTH_, VAL_, BIZ_)
3. All services must implement error logging middleware
4. Sensitive information must be sanitized before logging
5. Stack traces only in non-production environments

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent debugging experience across services
- Improved error tracking and analytics
- Better developer experience when handling errors
- Simplified client-side error handling

### Negative
- Initial development overhead to implement standard
- Teams need to refactor existing error handling
- Training required for new standard

### Mitigations
- Provide shared libraries for common languages
- Create migration guides and templates
- Set reasonable timeline for adoption
