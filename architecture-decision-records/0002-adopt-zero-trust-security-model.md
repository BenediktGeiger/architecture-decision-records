# 2. Adopt Zero-Trust Security Model

Date: 2025-01-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Our organization is rapidly scaling with remote workers and cloud services
- Traditional perimeter-based security is becoming obsolete
- Increasing sophistication of cyber threats and internal vulnerabilities
- Need for granular access control and continuous verification
- Growing compliance requirements across different regions
- Multiple cloud providers and hybrid infrastructure deployment

## Decision

We will implement a Zero-Trust security architecture across our organization. Key principles include:

- Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
- Use least-privilege access: Limit user access with Just-In-Time (JIT) and Just-Enough-Access (JEA)
- Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access using microperimeters
- Implement continuous monitoring and automated response
- Enforce end-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access
- Deploy microsegmentation at the workload level

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced security posture and reduced attack surface
- Better visibility into access patterns and potential threats
- Improved compliance with regulatory requirements
- More flexible and secure remote work capabilities
- Reduced risk of lateral movement in case of breach

### Negative
- Initial implementation complexity and learning curve
- Need for comprehensive documentation and training
- Potential short-term impact on development velocity
- Additional operational overhead for access management
- Investment in new security tools and infrastructure
