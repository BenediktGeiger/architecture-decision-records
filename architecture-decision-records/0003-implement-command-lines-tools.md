# 3. Implement Command line tools

Date: 2025-01-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our team needs to develop a set of command-line tools for managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). The key considerations are:

1. Cross-platform compatibility
2. Ease of installation and maintenance
3. Ability to integrate with existing development workflows
4. Low learning curve for developers

Unix shell scripts present a viable implementation option since most development environments, including Windows (via WSL/Git Bash), macOS, and Linux distributions, support them natively.

Current alternatives considered:
- Python scripts (requires Python installation)
- Node.js tools (requires Node.js runtime)
- Go binaries (requires compilation for different platforms)


## Decision

We will implement our ADR management tools as Unix shell scripts, specifically targeting POSIX-compliant shells (sh). The scripts will:

1. Use basic Unix commands and shell features available across platforms
2. Avoid dependencies on specific shells like Bash or Zsh
3. Follow shell scripting best practices for maintainability
4. Include clear documentation and usage examples
5. Be distributed as simple text files that can be copied into any project

This approach leverages the ubiquity of shell environments while keeping the implementation simple and portable.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences:

1. **Easy Installation**: Scripts can be deployed by simple file copying, without package managers or build tools
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Works across Unix-like systems and Windows (via WSL/Git Bash)
3. **No External Dependencies**: Relies only on standard Unix tools available in most environments
4. **Immediate Usage**: Developers can start using tools without additional setup
5. **Version Control Friendly**: Shell scripts are text files that work well with Git

### Challenges and Risks:

1. **Limited Features**: Complex operations may be harder to implement compared to full programming languages
2. **Testing Complexity**: Shell scripts can be harder to test thoroughly
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: As scripts grow, maintaining POSIX compliance across different shells requires careful attention
4. **Performance**: For large operations, shell scripts may be slower than compiled alternatives
